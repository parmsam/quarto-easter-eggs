filters:
  - easter-eggs

This filter ports [WeiChiaChang](https://github.com/WeiChiaChang)'s [Easter Egg Collection](https://github.com/WeiChiaChang/easter-egg-collection/tree/master) over to Quarto. The extension lets you type a keyword and see something special pop in on the web page.

After installing the extension, add it as filter in your Quarto file YAML header. Then you can type one of the keywords and something special will show up. It's pretty cute. Here's what's available:
